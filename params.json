During my PhD, I spent a year at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Bonn, Germany,  and two years visiting the Warwick Mathematics Institute, UK. Previous to joining the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Emory University. Prior to joining Emory, I taught at the University of Georgia and was a Fields Postdoctoral Fellow at the Fields Institute, Canada.\r\n\r\n### (@jeremyallenjacobson)",
